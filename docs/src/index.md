# BarsAndStripes.jl Documentation

The Bars and Stripes (BAS) ensemble consists of images in a ``m \times n`` pixel grid.
It is defined by:

* MacKay, David JC. Information theory, inference and learning algorithms. Cambridge university press, 2003.

We can quote their definition:

> Each sample is generated by first picking an orientation, horizontal or vertical; then, for each row of spins in that orientation (each bar or stripe respectively), switching all spins on with probability 1/2.

Note that following this prescription, all images do not have the same probability.
The probability of obtaining any particular bar pattern (excluding full or empty) is ``1 / 2^{n+1}``,
the probability of obtaining any particular stripe pattern (excluding full or empty) is ``1 / 2^{m+1}``,
and the probability of obtaining the empty image (or the full image) equals ``1 / 2^{n+1} + 1 / 2^{m+1}``.
